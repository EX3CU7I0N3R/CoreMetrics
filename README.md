## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up and run the **CoreMetrics** project on your local development environment.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CoreMetrics.git
cd CoreMetrics
```

---

### 2. Set Up the Python Environment

Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate (macOS/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 3. Configure the MySQL Database

1. **Start your MySQL server.**
2. **Create a new database** named `coremetrics` (or any name of your choice).
3. **Import the SQL dump** to create all tables and insert sample data:

```bash
mysql -u root -p coremetrics < load.sql
```

To avoid hardcoding credentials, use a `.env` file to store your database configuration:

```bash
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=coremetrics
```

---

### 4. Launch the Streamlit App

Run the main dashboard:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

This will start the CoreMetrics dashboard in your browser at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501).
